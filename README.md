# JWR site plug
## Goal
The goal is to use GitHub for version control of a WordPress plugin that I'm using for all my custom functions.

## Execution


## Notes
The file structure my change wildly. I'm on the fence. I can't decide if all files should be in directories by language (php vs js) or by function. I normally do the former but I don't think I will this time. 

## Requirements
I use ACF Pro a lot. Currently, that is the only requirement.
